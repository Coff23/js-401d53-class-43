## Problem Domain

- During the day I will notice that I have gone a few hours without drinking something or worse I will go all day and realize that I have been drinking but nothing that I drank was water.

- Create an app that will send notifications to your phone every hour if you have not checked in with your hourly water intake.

## User Stories

- As an user I want to be able to see my progress as I go throughout the day ie. a progress bar or some sort of animation.

- As an user I want to be able to revieve notifications if I have not met my hourly goal for water consumption.

- As an user I want to be able to see how much water I have drank throughout the day.
